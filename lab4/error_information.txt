[DRC NSTD-1] Unspecified I/O Standard: 18 out of 18 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT',
 instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power 
or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components 
to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a 
bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with
 unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1]. 
 NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that 
file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: sw[7:0], led[7:0], clk, and left.
